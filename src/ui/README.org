#+TITLE:   Ethan UI (Immediate Mode UI)

* NOTEs:

There are some drawbacks right now of my ImGui:
- Fix sized container (Only support 48 opened window right now, which would make some features may be hard to implement, such as the graph editor, text editor, etc...).
- Some bad naming conventions (See TODO).
- Some copy value which may cause slowness -> I may need to reconsider the flow of my ImGui design.
- Cannot have same name on different widgets. <- This may be critical.
